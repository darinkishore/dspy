## Suggest
The `Suggest` class is a type of `Constraint` that represents a suggestion in the DSPy framework. It takes a boolean result and an optional message as parameters. If the result is `False`, it raises a `DSPySuggestionError` unless `bypass_suggest` is set in the settings.

Example usage:
```python
suggestion = Suggest(result=True, msg="This is a test suggestion")
```

## Constraint
The `Constraint` class is a base class for `Assert` and `Suggest`. It takes a boolean result and an optional message as parameters.

Example usage:
```python
constraint = Constraint(result=True, msg="This is a test constraint")
```

## noop_handler
The `noop_handler` function is an assertion handler that bypasses both assertions and suggestions. It takes a function as a parameter and returns a wrapper function that bypasses assertions and suggestions when called.

Example usage:
```python
@noop_handler
def test_function():
    pass
```

## bypass_suggest_handler
The `bypass_suggest_handler` function is an assertion handler that bypasses suggestions only. It takes a function as a parameter and returns a wrapper function that bypasses suggestions when called.

Example usage:
```python
@bypass_suggest_handler
def test_function():
    pass
```

## bypass_assert_handler
The `bypass_assert_handler` function is an assertion handler that bypasses assertions only. It takes a function as a parameter and returns a wrapper function that bypasses assertions when called.

Example usage:
```python
@bypass_assert_handler
def test_function():
    pass
```

## assert_no_except_handler
The `assert_no_except_handler` function is an assertion handler that ignores assertion failures and returns `None`. It takes a function as a parameter and returns a wrapper function that ignores assertion failures when called.

Example usage:
```python
@assert_no_except_handler
def test_function():
    pass
```

## suggest_backtrack_handler
The `suggest_backtrack_handler` function is an assertion handler for backtracking suggestions. It takes a function, a boolean `bypass_suggest`, and an integer `max_backtracks` as parameters. It returns a wrapper function that re-runs the latest predictor up to `max_backtracks` times, with updated signature if a suggestion fails.

Example usage:
```python
@suggest_backtrack_handler(bypass_suggest=True, max_backtracks=2)
def test_function():
    pass
```

## handle_assert_forward
The `handle_assert_forward` function is used to handle assertions. It wraps the `forward` method of a module with an assertion handler. It takes an assertion handler and handler arguments as parameters.

Example usage:
```python
forward = handle_assert_forward(assertion_handler, **handler_args)
```

## assert_transform_module
The `assert_transform_module` function is used to transform a module to handle assertions. It replaces the `forward` method of the module with a version that handles assertions. It takes a module, an assertion handler, and handler arguments as parameters.

Example usage:
```python
module = assert_transform_module(module, assertion_handler=default_assertion_handler, **handler_args)
