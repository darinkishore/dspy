# Retrieve Module in DSPy

The `retrieve` module is a part of the DSPy framework, a Python-based framework designed for advanced tasks with language and retrieval models. 

## Functionality

The `retrieve` module takes a search query as input and returns one or more potentially relevant passages from a corpus. This is achieved through the `Retrieve` class, which is initialized with a parameter `k` that determines the number of passages to return. The `Retrieve` class has a `forward` method that accepts a query or a list of queries and returns a `Prediction` object containing the retrieved passages.

## Philosophical Usage/Purpose

In the context of the DSPy framework, the `retrieve` module plays a crucial role in the systematic optimization and integration of various components like prompting, fine-tuning, reasoning, self-improvement, and augmentation. It provides a composable and declarative module for retrieval tasks, allowing for a more modular approach to task adaptation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `retrieve` module:

```python
# Import the Retrieve class
from dspy.retrieve import Retrieve

# Initialize a Retrieve object
retrieve = Retrieve(k=5)

# Use the Retrieve object to get relevant passages for a query
prediction = retrieve("What is the capital of France?")
print(prediction.passages)
```

## Additional Information

When using the `retrieve` module, it's important to note that the `Retrieve` class's `forward` method expects a string or a list of strings as input. If a single string is provided, it is treated as a single query. If a list of strings is provided, each string is treated as a separate query.
