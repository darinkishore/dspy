DSPy: *Programming*—not prompting—Foundation Models
----------------------------------------------------

Language Model Clients
----------------------

Language Model Clients in DSPy are interfaces to interact with language models. They provide a unified API to make requests to different language models. For more details, refer to the :doc:`language_models_client`.

Retrieval Model Clients
-----------------------

Retrieval Model Clients are interfaces for interacting with retrieval models. They provide a unified API to make requests to different retrieval models. For more details, refer to the :doc:`retrieval_models_client`.

Local Models
------------

Local Models in DSPy are models that are run locally on your machine. They can be used to perform tasks such as text generation, translation, and more. For more details, refer to the :doc:`local_models`.

Modules
-------

Modules in DSPy are the building blocks of your models. They encapsulate a specific functionality and can be combined to create complex models. For a list of available modules and their descriptions, refer to the :doc:`modules`.

Teleprompters
-------------

Teleprompters in DSPy are tools that help in generating prompts for the models. They can be used to improve the performance of your models. For a list of available teleprompters and their descriptions, refer to the :doc:`teleprompters`.
