### Sorting Colors by Suffix

The `sorted_by_suffix` method sorts the colors by suffix if `sort_by_suffix` is `True` and returns the sorted colors.

## Usage

The `Colors` class provides a flexible and efficient way to handle and manipulate the colors dataset. Here is an example of how to use the `Colors` class:

```python
# Initialize the Colors class
colors = Colors(sort_by_suffix=True)

# Access the train and dev datasets
train_data = colors.train
dev_data = colors.dev
